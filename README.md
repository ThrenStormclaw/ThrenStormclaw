- 👋 Hi, I’m @ThrenStormclaw (they/them, i guess)
- I'm a cute 🟨⬜️🟪⬛️🐇 nonbinary bunny 🐇🟨⬜️🟪⬛️ who likes occult secrets and magicks.
- I also like stories with intimate characterization and sweeping scope.
- (If you read Homestuck as a teenager, and liked the *structure* of it in spite of the nearly nonsensical plot, might I reccommend):
   - Jon Bois' masterpiece "17776" (https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football)
   - The video game Rain World
   - The book "The Starless Sea" by Erin Morgenstern,
   - "AsteroidQuest" by LagoTrope (WARNING: IT IS INCOMPLETE, POSSIBLY ABANDONNED: https://questden.org/wiki/AsteroidQuest)
   - Or the book "Cloud Atlas" by David Mitchell
- If you have any stuff that's similar to those in scope and tone, send me an email! (Unless it's one of those "multigenerational story" books with two storie; one in the past, one in the present. Those just don't inteterest me in the slightest, sorry).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to function as an adult, but for real this time! Having executive dysfunction is hard, but I'm getting there!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing in particular, really. If you'd want me to help with something, you could ask, I guess. I'm really not that good at programming though--just good enough to break things in interesting ways sometimes.
- 📫 How to reach me: Shoot me an email at \[literally my username\] at HareBrainedMage [✨ dot ✨] c o m. (Screw email scraper bots. If you made one that's good enough to read and interpret that though, you probably deserve to reach me anyways).

- Oh yeah, I'm currently working on a project to make the LSJ files (literally just JSON) in Baldur's Gate 3 more human readable so that artists and other creatives can more easily reference all the graphical data in the game! Larian did a lot of cool stuff with the graphics, and it's great way to learn about mesh and texture modelling, from what I've heard--hopefully my unpacker project makes the learning curve just a tad gentler for some.
<!--- Throw a scavenger hunt clue or something in here, maybe?--->
