- 👋 Hi, I’m @ThrenStormclaw (they/them, i guess)
- I'm a cute 🟨⬜️🟪⬛️🐇 nonbinary bunny 🐇🟨⬜️🟪⬛️ who likes occult secrets and magicks.
- I also like stories with intimate characterization and sweeping scope.
- (If you read Homestuck as a teenager, and liked the *structure* of it in spite of the nearly nonsensical plot, might I reccommend):
   - Jon Bois' masterpiece "17776" (https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football)
   - The video game Rain World
   - The book "The Starless Sea" by Erin Morgenstern,
   - "AsteroidQuest" by LagoTrope (WARNING: IT IS INCOMPLETE, POSSIBLY ABANDONNED: https://questden.org/wiki/AsteroidQuest)
   - Or the book "Cloud Atlas" by David Mitchell
- If you have any stuff that's similar to those in scope and tone, send me an email! (Unless it's one of those books with two stories one in the past, one in the present. I'm just sick of those, sorry).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to function as an adult, but for real this time! Having executive dysfunction is hard, but I'm getting there!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing in particular, really. If you'd want me to help with something, you could ask, I guess. I'm really not that good at programming though--just good enough to break things in interesting ways sometimes.
- 📫 How to reach me: Shoot me an email at \[literally my username\] at HareBrainedMage [✨ dot ✨] c o m. (Screw email scraper bots. If you made one that's good enough to read and interpret that though, you probably deserve to reach me anyways).
<!--- Throw a scavenger hunt clue or something in here, maybe?--->
